# 🙇🏻‍♀️ Hello I'm junior Backend dev JIYOUNG HAN

## The reason why i became a developer
While working as a Visual Merchandiser before a developer, I had a desire to challenge development while working in an inefficient environment because the product code required for work could not be managed due to a problem with the in-house program. So this opportunity led me to become a backend developer.
