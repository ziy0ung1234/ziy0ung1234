# 🙇🏻‍♀️ Hello I'm junior Backend dev JIYOUNG HAN

## 🖱 The reason why i became a developer
While working as a Visual Merchandiser before a developer, I had a desire to challenge development while working in an inefficient environment because the product code required for work could not be managed due to a problem with the in-house program. So this opportunity led me to become a backend developer.


## 🎓 Education
`>wecode bootcamp` (2021.03-2021.05) 
</br></br>
 I grew up by developing my capabilities to become a backend developer at the Wecode Boot Camp. Also, I learned not only general development knowledge, but also development philosophy and the habit of studying voluntarily.
